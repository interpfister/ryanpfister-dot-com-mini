If you’re in a bar with loud music it’s difficult to hold a conversation without yelling. I’ve been wondering if it’s possible to avoid the yelling and have a pleasant conversation by using hearing aid technology.

It turns out there are somewhat classy options for this. However, they’re expensive and it appears you need to go through a doctor to purchase them.

A bootleg alternative is to download an app that routes your phone microphone to your headphones. Then you can wear your headphones and hold your phone next to the person talking to hear well. I’ve successfully tested this with [Microphone Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=multimediasolvn.app.promicrophone&hl=en) for Android.

The problem with this approach is that you look like a dork for wearing headphones and holding your phone in a bar. Consensus from discussion with my friends is that the best approach is to just try to relocate the conversation to a quieter bar.
